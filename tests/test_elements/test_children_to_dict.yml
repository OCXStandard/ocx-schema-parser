ComposedOf:
  Cardinality: '[1, 1]'
  Child: ComposedOf
  Choice: false
  Description: The element representing the structural concepts which composes the
    structural Panel. If no ComposedOf definition is given, the Panel is treated as
    a virtual panel. A virtual panel is used to limit other objects defining the model
    topology.

CutBy:
  Cardinality: '[0, 1]'
  Child: CutBy
  Choice: false
  Description: A structural concept defining a cut-out in a surface defined by a parametric
    hole or a set of generic trim curves. Cut-out on panels will cut material on all
    the panel plates touched by the cut-out shape. Apply cutBy either on Panel or
    on Plate level, but not on both.

  Type: ocx:CutBy_T
  Use: opt.
LimitedBy:
  Cardinality: '[1, 1]'
  Child: LimitedBy
  Choice: false
  Description: The references to limiting objects forming a closed contour of the
    parent element. It is not required that the set of objects is ordered in the correct
    sequence.
  Namespace: ocx
  Type: ocx:LimitedBy_T
  Use: req.
OuterContour:
  Cardinality: '[0, 1]'
  Child: OuterContour
  Choice: false
  Description: The geometry of the outer closed contour limiting a surface, represented
    by a set of trim curves or a closed curve primitive.
  Namespace: ocx
  Type: ocx:Contour3D_T
  Use: opt.
PhysicalProperties:
  Cardinality: '[0, 1]'
  Child: PhysicalProperties
  Choice: false
  Description: Basic physical properties of structure objects (weight and centre of
    gravity). These properties are provided by the exporting application and can be
    used as a quality measure by the receiving application to ensure correctness of
    the import.
  Namespace: ocx
  Type: ocx:PhysicalProperties_T
  Use: opt.
SplitBy:
  Cardinality: '[0, 1]'
  Child: SplitBy
  Choice: false
  Description: Structural concepts defining the subdivision of a panel into plates
    split by one or more seams.
  Namespace: ocx
  Type: ocx:SplitBy_T
  Use: opt.
StiffenedBy:
  Cardinality: '[0, 1]'
  Child: StiffenedBy
  Choice: false
  Description: Structural concept defining the stiffeners which belongs to a panel.
  Namespace: ocx
  Type: ocx:StiffenedBy_T
  Use: opt.
UnboundedGeometry:
  Cardinality: '[1, 1]'
  Child: UnboundedGeometry
  Choice: false
  Description: The unbounded surface geometry of the parent element. Can be a patch
    of connected surfaces.
  Namespace: ocx
  Type: ocx:UnboundedGeometry_T
  Use: req.
